# Data Visualizations
Miscellaneous data visualization projects I've done for fun.

## Baby Name Map

Explore baby name data through space and time. This interactive visualization uses data from the SSA to show how a name's popularity has changed over time in the US. What trends and patterns can you find?

## Group Project Texts

A d3-based visualization of text messages sent while completing a group project. Once the project had ended, I exported the contents of the group text using the [Export Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhintz.exportmessages&hl=en) Android app. After cleaning up the raw data, I used d3 to create a timeline showing how many messages were sent, when, and by whom. I also included important dates and deadlines. The resulting visualization shows that the stress and organized chaos of a group project can, in fact, be quantified.
